# Basic algorithms
#### Basic algorithms for sorting, searching, tree traversal, caching calculations in TypeScript

## What's there?
- Binary search
- Selection sort
- Bubble sort
- Quick sort
- Tree breadth traversal
- Iterative tree traversal
- Recursive tree traversal
- Calculation caching

## How to start?
The **src** folder contains folders with algorithms. In the root of the project just run the `tsc` command to get JS scripts in the **dest** folder.
